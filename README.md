# FureverFriends
Group-Project: Create a fake company website for a Pet Supplies Company.
# Furever Friends – Pet Supplies Company

*My very first group project – a special milestone in my frontend journey.*

This project was part of our examination after completing **Module 1 (HTML & CSS)** in my Frontend Developer program. We were a team of 3, and it was the first time I worked with **Git**, **GitHub**, and collaborative coding.

While I was new to Git workflows, one of our teammates had previous IT experience and guided us through forking, committing, pushing, and pull requests — it was an incredible learning experience that gave me confidence in using Git effectively.

## My Contributions:
- 💡 **Project Name & Logo**: Designed the logo, chose the project name, and defined the color palette & fonts.
- 🎨 **Responsive Navbar**: Built a fully responsive navigation bar, with a mobile hamburger menu.
- 🖼️ **Reference Page Layout**: Designed the layout using **Flexbox** and **SASS**.

## Project Features:
- Fully responsive design for all screen sizes.
- Smooth transitions for the navbar.
- Pet listing and filter options.

## Tech Stack:
- **HTML** & **CSS**
- **Flexbox**
- **SASS**

## Reflection:
This project will always be close to my heart — it marked the beginning of my journey into frontend development. From that point on, I’ve never looked back. I’ve grown into someone who truly **loves coding, designing**, and turning ideas into beautiful user interfaces. Choosing frontend was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made — it feels like this is exactly what I’m meant to do 💙
